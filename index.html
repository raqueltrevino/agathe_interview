  <h1 class= "title">BLOSSOMING ARTIST: AGATHE RENOU</h1>
 
   <div class= "intro"> Agathe Renou is an artist currently in her second year at Parsons School Of Design. She is a communication designer who uses art not only as a means of self-expression but also as a tool for creating awareness on the absurdity of societal standards. Although she mostly does this through the use of photography and typography, she enjoys exploring several different artistic styles but often finds herself drawn to surrealism. Art has created her ambition and given her the means to amplify her ideas. She wants to continue developing her creative capacities by working outside her comfort zone, examining things from different angles, and questioning her surroundings.
